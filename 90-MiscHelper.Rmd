Introduction

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This chapter explains some functions or commands that may be helpful to the DEA researcher and also describes some that don't exist yet but could be helpful.

## Filtering Nonpositive Columns

This function is a quick and dirty shortcut that will eliminate columns that do not contain a positive value.  The primary use for this in a DEA setting is to eliminate columns of DMUs from a lambda matrix that are never used for comparison.  In traditional DEA models, this would mean eliminating the columns of inefficient DMUs so that only the efficient ones are shown.  

This can be incorporated as a single line of code but is tricky enough, we will also make it into a function.

Let's revisit the Baker Hughes Corporation Directional Drilling example from Chapter 9.

Let's start by looking at the full envelopment results of the Baker Hughes example from earlier in the book.  This table shows both the efficiency score and every value of the matrix of $\lambda$ values.

```{r BHCorp, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
NX <- 1
NY <- 4
ND <- 14

DMUnames <- list(c(LETTERS[1:ND]))               # DMU names: A, B ...
Xnames<- lapply(list(rep("X",NX)),paste0,1:NX)   # Input names: x1 ...
Ynames<- lapply(list(rep("Y",NY)),paste0,1:NY)   # Output names: y1 ...
Vnames<- lapply(list(rep("v",NX)),paste0,1:NX)   # Input weight names: v1 ...
Unames<- lapply(list(rep("u",NY)),paste0,1:NY)   # Output weight names: u1 ...
SXnames<- lapply(list(rep("sx",NX)),paste0,1:NX) # Input slack names: sx1 ...
SYnames<- lapply(list(rep("sy",NY)),paste0,1:NY) # Output slack names: sy1 ...
Lambdanames<- lapply(list(rep("L_",ND)),paste0,LETTERS[1:ND])

XBH <- matrix(c(1.07, 1.06, 0.325, 1.60, 0.55, 0.2, 0.35, 
                0.53, 0.21, 0.16, 0.07, 1.95, 5.59, 3.10),
                ncol=NX,dimnames=c(DMUnames,Xnames))

YBH <- matrix(c( 32,  50,  40,  30,  25,   8,   2, 
                 12,  10, 0.8,   3, 300,  60, 240,
                8.2, 7.6, 7.6, 7.1, 7.0, 6.0, 5.9, 
                5.8, 5.8, 5.4, 5.3, 6.8, 6.2, 6.2,
                7.5, 7.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.0, 6.1, 6.2, 
                5.8, 5.8, 5.6, 5.4, 6.1, 6.9, 6.6,
                8.0, 6.4, 5.3, 5.5, 5.1, 6.9, 6.6, 
                5.4, 4.7, 6.1, 6.5, 6.4, 6.8, 7.1),
                ncol=NY,dimnames=c(DMUnames,Ynames))

library(MultiplierDEA)
library(pander)

resBH<-DeaMultiplierModel(XBH,YBH,rts = "vrs", orientation="input")

# Rename some of the results row and column labels
dimnames(resBH$Lambda)<-c(Lambdanames,Lambdanames)
dimnames(resBH$vx)<-c(DMUnames,Xnames)
dimnames(resBH$uy)<-c(DMUnames,Ynames)

pander(cbind(resBH$Efficiency,resBH$Lambda), 
       caption="Envelopment results for Baker Hughes Corporation analysis.")
```

Notice that the data table is messy.  In particular, an inefficient unit such as J is never used for creating a target for any other unit.  Therefore the entire column (L_J) is zero.  We want to be careful about simply removing columns since the full matrix makes further analysis simpler but for viewing, we don't need to include that data.  Chester Ismay contributed an elegant line of code based on testing to see if the column sum is zero and if so, remove the column.  Let's see how this affects the results.

```{r displaysmallertable1}
df <- cbind(resBH$Efficiency,resBH$Lambda)
pander(tempdf <- df[, colSums(df) != 0],
       caption = "Envelopment results displaying only columns containing 
       positive values.")
```

Notice that the second table is much easier to interpret.  Simply removing unused columns that cause the table to be broken up allows the table to fit much better on a screen or page.

While the code is elegant, it does decrease readability of the code.  Given that lambda matrices are frequently examined, let's make it easier for the reader by compartmentalizing this as a function.  This is a good chance to review the use of function.  

This function is simply passed a dataframe or matrix and it will return the same object without columns that are all zero (more precisely that add to exactly zero.)

```{r poscolfunction}
poscol<-function(df) {
  positive.columns <- df[, colSums(df) != 0]
  return (positive.columns)
}
```

Now, let's test our function.

```{r displaysmallertable2}
pander(poscol(cbind(resBH$Efficiency,resBH$Lambda)), 
       caption="Envelopment results using poscol function.")
```

Note that this function has some drawbacks:

* Since the tests is that all column values add up to exactly zero, it may be confused by a very small $\lambda$ value such as $10^{-10}$ that is functionally equivalent to zero from the LP solver. 
* Negative values may problems of a column to be falsely included or excluded but this is unlikely given that all values of lambda are constrained to be non-negative.
* Columns without numerical values such as text labels could cause difficulty.

Perhaps in future work it would be good to add some testing for input validation of the function.  

## Define Names

For many datasets, we simply want to have DMUs named with sequential letters, numbered inputs, and numbered outputs.  Defining lists of names every time for these items and the resulting items results can become time consuming.  Instead, let's create this as a function as well.

This function simply needs the number of DMUs, inputs, and outputs.

```{r DEAnamesfunction}
DEAnames<-function(NX, NY, ND) {

  DMUnames <- list(c(LETTERS[1:ND]))               

  Xnames<- lapply(list(rep("X",NX)),paste0,1:NX)
  Ynames<- lapply(list(rep("Y",NY)),paste0,1:NY)
  Vnames<- lapply(list(rep("v",NX)),paste0,1:NX)   
  Unames<- lapply(list(rep("u",NY)),paste0,1:NY)   
  SXnames<- lapply(list(rep("sx",NX)),paste0,1:NX) 
  SYnames<- lapply(list(rep("sy",NY)),paste0,1:NY) 
  Lambdanames<- lapply(list(rep("L_",ND)),paste0,LETTERS[1:ND])

  allnames<-list(DMUnames=DMUnames,
                 Xnames=Xnames,Ynames=Ynames,
                 Vnames=Vnames,
                 Unames=Unames,
                 SXnames=SXnames,
                 SYnames=SYnames,
                 Lambdanames=Lambdanames)
  
  return(allnames)
}
```

Let's see what the function does.

```{r nameexample}
NX <-1
NY <- 4
ND <- 10

modelnames<-DEAnames(1, 4, 10)
modelnames
```

Future work for this function could include the following:

* Add more potential names such as for targets and scale information as they are used
* Allow for optional base names of inputs, outputs, and DMUs.  
* Change "L_" to actual $\lambda$ symbol.  

Some notes from earlier attempts to embed lambda symbol into R code.

```{r}
#Lambdanames<- lapply(list(rep("\u03BB",ND)),paste0,LETTERS[1:ND])
              # \u03BB is unicode for lambda symbol.
              # This would lambda symbol to be embedded
              #    in row or columns.
              # Unfortunately implementation of unicode is not
              #    consistent enough across different platforms.
              # Instead, capital "L" is used for lambda symbol.
```


## Function for Drawing Input-Output Diagram

I find visual models sometimes clarify the model.  Let's draw an input-output diagram DEA models.  This diagram has inputs feeding into a box and outputs coming out.  I used the very rich DiagrammeR package for this function.  For a comprehensive description of options in the package, this site is very useful.  http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/graphviz_and_mermaid.html 

Let's start by hard coding a one-input, four-output CCR input-oriented model.  We will retain the Xnames and Ynames list of input and output names respectively from the previous section.

```{r TryingIODiagram1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
library(DiagrammeRsvg)
library(rsvg)
library(htmltools)
a <- "'"  
Xlabels <- c(mapply(paste0, a, Xnames, a)) 
              # Wraps names with ' (backtick)

Ylabels <- c(mapply(paste0, a, Ynames, a))

Modellabel <- c(mapply(paste0, a, "\n\nCCRIO\n\n ", a)) 
              # Pads model name with two carriage returns
              #    to make it a taller rectangle and look better

#  Define labels for the inputs and outputs
nodelabels <- paste(c(Xlabels,Ylabels), collapse="; ")

#  Define edge 
edges <- paste0( 
  Xlabels[1], "->", Modellabel [1], " ",
  Modellabel [1], "->", Ylabels[1], " ",
  Modellabel [1], "->", Ylabels[2], " ",
  Modellabel [1], "->", Ylabels[3], " ",
  Modellabel [1], "->", Ylabels[4], " "
)

#  Build Diagram:
demoIOdiagram <- grViz(
  paste0(" digraph hardcoded_IO_Diagram {

    # a 'graph' statement
    graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10, rankdir = LR]

    # several 'node' statements
    node [shape = plaintext,
    fontname = Helvetica]
    ", nodelabels, "

    node [shape = box, fillcolor = green,
    fontname = Helvetica]
    ", Modellabel, "

    # several 'edge' statements
    ", edges, "
    }"
  )
)

#stnds.qa.d2 <- grViz(stnds.qa.d)
tmp<-capture.output(rsvg_png(charToRaw(export_svg(demoIOdiagram)),
                             'demoIOdiagram.png', height = 1440))

```

![Demo IO Diagram](demoIOdiagram.png){#fig:demoIOdiagram width=25% }  
Okay.  Now let's generalize it for an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs.


```{r TryingIODiagram2, dpi=144}
library(DiagrammeR)
a <- "'"

NX <- lengths(Xnames)     # Number of inputs
NY <- lengths(Ynames)     # Number of outputs

Xlabels <- c(mapply(paste0, a, Xnames, a))

Ylabels <- c(mapply(paste0, a, Ynames, a))

nboxpad <- max(floor(1+NX/2), floor(1+NY/2)) 

boxpadding <- paste(rep("\n",nboxpad),collapse='')  
                    # Build line returns 

modellabel <- paste(boxpadding, "CCRIO", boxpadding,
                     collapse="")
  # Want to vertically pad returns, \n's top and bottom
  #    to balance the height of the boxspace figure

# Define the nodes for the inputs and outputs
nodelabels <- paste(c(Xlabels,Ylabels), collapse="; ")

# Define the edges (arrows) for inputs and outputs
Xedges <- paste(c(mapply(paste0, Xlabels,"->", 
                         Modellabel [1], " " )), collapse="")
Yedges <- paste(c(mapply(paste, Modellabel [1], "->", 
                         Ylabels," "  )),collapse="")

# Combine edges for inputs and outputs
edges <- paste0( Xedges, Yedges)
    # All edges or arrows are for inputs or outputs

##  Plot graph:
generalIO <- grViz(
  paste0(" digraph Input_Output_Diagram {

    # a 'graph' statement
    graph [overlap = false, # True or false both work fine
           fontsize = 10, 
           rankdir = LR,    # Left to right structure
           layout = dot]    # dot layout is best for this, 
                            # neato, twopi, circo are not suitable

    # several 'node' statements
    node [shape = plaintext,  # Avoids any outline or shape
    fontname = Helvetica]
    ", nodelabels, "

    node [shape = box, fillcolor = green,
    fontname = Helvetica]
    ", Modellabel, "

    # several 'edge' statements
    ", edges, "
    }"
  )
)

tmp<-capture.output(rsvg_png(charToRaw(export_svg(generalIO)),
                             'generalIO.png', height = 1440))

```

Now let's try loading it from Rmarkdown.

#### Optional Future Features for Drawing Input-Output Diagrams

In the future, these might be nice features to add:

* Optional: to generate a table listing inputs and outputs. This actually should be easy.
* Optional: parenthetical information (abbreviation, units, or comments)
* Optional text to include in the box
* Long-term optional network diagramming where outputs from one stage serve as inputs to other stage(s)
